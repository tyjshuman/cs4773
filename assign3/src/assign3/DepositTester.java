public class DepositTester {

	// Tests each of the 3 Adapters for
	// Image, Text, and PDF by calling a
	// readCheckDeposit operation from the
	// controller. The string that is passed in
	// indicates which adapter is to be used.
	// In the "text" case you will need to prompt the
	// user for all the information that is on the
	// check (account number listed on check, routing
	// number listed on check, amount of check, and
	// name of the recipient), you may choose arbitrary
	// check information as long is it will produce a
	// valid transaction and show a change when the
	// next MemberInfo print is called. The "image" case
	// will pass a file name containing the image of the
	// check, from there find and use APIs to extract the
	// information from the check (same information as
	// the text case). The "pdf" case is very similar to
	// the image case, it will also pass a file and
	// so APIs will be needed to extract the information
	// from that file (again, same as above). (Note, you may
	// choose to modify the file path if wish to orginize
	// your java project to place them in separate folders).
	// As shown, the MemberInfo is printed at every stage. It
	// should show updated balances and logged transactions
	// at each step. Note that we are not using a deposit
	// slip in this assignment. That means that you will need
	// to look up the member who is the recipient (by name
	// or id) of the check and select one of their accounts
	// to deposit the check amount into (you can arbitrarily
	// select the account as long as the print out of the
	// MemberInfo shows the transaction). You will also need
	// to debit/withdraw that same amount from the account
	// that issued the check (if it exists in this bank, if
	// it doesn't than it must be from outside the bank and
	// we aren't going to worry about it for this assignment).
	// Also, the only class that this Tester class should have
	// DIRECT contact/association with is the Controller. No
	// other classes should be directly called. (You can rename
	// the Controller if you like, as long as it is fitting).
	// There will be more test cases for when the assignment
	// is graded so please feel free to implement your own
	// test cases and sample files. If you do, then please include
	// these additional test cases and files in your final turn in.
	// As a final note, please make sure to comment all your
	// classes and operations. Please include the patterns
	// used to assign/create EVERY operation to/in the class
	// it was put in (DO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE PATTERNS FOR
	// EVRY OPERATION IN EVERY CLASS, YOU WILL BE MARKED OFF
	// IF YOU DO!!!)
